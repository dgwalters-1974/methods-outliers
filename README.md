# methods-outliers
An investigation of unsupervised outlier detection methods applied to financial data. This repo is very much a 'work in progress' exploration of the data and how statistical techniques such as Mahalanobis distance or Isolation Forest may be used to single out anomalies in a multidimensional tabular dataset. More recent methods such as autoencoders and some more sophisticated time-series analyses are left for later work.
